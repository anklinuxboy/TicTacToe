TicTacToe by Ankit Sharma
The folder structure is as follows -
/tictactoe
  /fonts
  /incld
    header files
  /src
    source files
  Makefile
  Readme.txt

From command line -
1. make to compile the source files.
2. ./tictactoe to play the game from the command line
3. make clean to remove the binary

Currently working on the AI version using MiniMax algorithm. 
I plan to implement the graphics version of the game using SFML library.
But that's for the future.
